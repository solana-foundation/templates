review this anchor-litesvm test example: https://github.com/brimigs/anchor-escrow-with-litesvm/blob/main/tests/utils-tests.rs to understand the most optimal way to write anchor-litesvm tests. Also review the crate's source code to understand even better: https://github.com/brimigs/anchor-litesvm. Then review all the litesvm tests in this codebase. Update them to make them as optimized as possible
