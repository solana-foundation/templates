# kit-expo-uniwind

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project pre-configured with [Uniwind](https://uniwind.dev/) for styling and Solana libraries.

## Technologies

- [Expo](https://expo.dev)
- [Uniwind](https://uniwind.dev/) (Tailwind CSS for React Native)
- [@solana/kit](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana-web3.js)
- [@wallet-ui/react-native-kit](https://github.com/wallet-ui/wallet-ui)

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

This steps builds the dependencies for the development client.

```bash
npm run android
```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a:

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).
